If you define your views and layouts in the xml files, 
load your resources from the res folder, 
and if you avoid more or less to mingle this things in your code, 
then your anyway following a MVC pattern.

So Far:
So now in our application we have something like this:

   1. the view asks controller for new data,
   2. the controller delegates the fetching of the data to the DAO
   3. the controller adds the data to the model
   4. the model sends notification that its state has changed
   5. the view updates to reflect the new state

Pretty cool separation of parts, eh?
